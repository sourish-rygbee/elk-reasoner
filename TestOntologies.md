# Test Ontologies #

A zip file containing all ontologies used in recent evaluations of ELK that we are allowed to distribute is available [here](https://elk-reasoner.googlecode.com/files/test_ontologies_02.zip).

Various ontologies for testing EL reasoners can be found on the Web.

  * SNOMED CT is not a free ontology but can be obtained free of charge for research purposes; see [IHTSDO](http://ihtsdo.org/) for further information.

  * [ANATOMY](https://elk-reasoner.googlecode.com/files/SNOMED-anatomy2012EL.zip) is an experimental remodeling of the ‘body structure’ hierarchy of SNOMED CT using role composition axioms.

  * The [EL version of GALEN](http://code.google.com/p/condor-reasoner/downloads/detail?name=EL-GALEN.owl&can=2&q=) was obtained from the version 7 of [CO-ODE GALEN](http://www.co-ode.org/galen/) by removing all inverse role, functional role, and role chain axioms.

  * Versions 7 and 8 of GALEN with non-regular role composition axioms can be obtained at [Open-GALEN](http://www.opengalen.org/sources/sources.html).

  * Recent versions of GO use interesting features such as negative occurrences of conjunctions and existential restrictions, and even disjointness axioms. A live version of GO is available from [Ontobee](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=GO).

There are many other EL ontologies on the Web, but most of them are trivial for classification because they use only a very limited set of features. Many such ontologies can be found at:

  * The [test ontology page for the CEL reasoner](http://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/~meng/toyont.html) includes older versions of GO, NCI, and GALEN.

  * The [Ontobee](http://www.ontobee.org/) and the [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/) servers list dozens of real-life ontologies, mostly in OBO format or converted from OBO to OWL; includes [GO](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=GO), [FMA](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=FMA), [ChEBI](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=CHEBI), [EMAP](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=EMAP), [Molecule Role](http://www.obofoundry.org/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?id=molecule_role), and [Fly Anatomy](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=FBbt).

  * FMA can also be downloaded from the [fma-in-owl](http://code.google.com/p/fma-in-owl/) project.
