# Some Projects that Use ELK #

This page lists some projects that use ELK for classification of OWL EL ontologies. [Let us know](Contact.md) if you use ELK in your project, we would be happy to mention it here.

  * [Aber-OWL](http://aber-owl.net/aber-owl/) is a framework for ontology-based access to biological data.
  * [Brain](http://loopasam.github.io/Brain/) a Java library to easily build and query OWL ontologies and knowledge bases.
  * The [Galaxy Project](http://galaxy.psu.edu/) is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research.
  * [Gene Ontology](http://www.geneontology.org) is formal ontology that represents over 40,000 biological concepts describing how genes encode biological functions at the molecular, cellular and tissue system levels.
  * The [GOAL Browser](http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/goal/) exploits OWL semantics to query over a combination of Gene Ontology, Mouse Phenotype and Human Disease Ontology annotations.
  * [Nova Hybrid Reasoner](http://centria.di.fct.unl.pt/nohr/) (NoHR) is a plug-in for Protégé that allows its users to query knowledge bases composed of an ontology in OWL 2 EL and a set of reasoning rules.
  * [Phenoscape](http://phenoscape.org) is an ontology-based infrastructure that enables linking phenotypes across different fields of biology by the semantic similarity of their descriptions.
  * [Snow Owl](http://www.b2international.com/portal/snow-owl) is a collaborative authoring tool for developing of ontologies based on [SNOMED CT](http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/).
  * [Uberon](http://uberon.github.io) is an integrated cross-species ontology covering anatomical structures in animals.
  * [Virtual Fly Brain](http://www.virtualflybrain.org) (VFB) - an interactive tool for neurobiologists to explore the detailed neuroanatomy, gene expression, and associated phenotypes of the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain.
